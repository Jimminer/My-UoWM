>The Online Registration Application is mandatory, but it does NOT COMPLETE your enrollment in the Department.

First year student, the procedure you need to follow to register is:
- **Completion of the Online Application for Registration and the solemn declaration stating that you are not enrolled in another University or department of Higher Education in Greece.**
- **Printing and signing the registration form and the solemn declaration.**
- **Submission of the application, the solemn declaration and all the required documents to the Department's Secretariat**

On the page  [www.uowm.gr/register](https://web.uowm.gr/register/) you will continue with your Online Application.
