# Open eClass registration

Visit the [Open eClass](https://eclass.uowm.gr/index.php?localize=en) page.

Click on **'Enter'** on the left.

Enter your username (it should be your academic e-mail, only without the "@uowm.gr") and password of your institutional account.

After that click on **'Submit'**.

Click on **'Subjects'** on the left, select the **'Undergraduate'** tab and then **'Department of Informatics'**.

Select the subjects of the semester you are enrolled in.

> It'd be a good idea to wait for the first lessons, as the professors will probably explain it more thoroughly.
